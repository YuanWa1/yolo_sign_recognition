*** Yolo-project-4337***


Description: This project focuses on American Sign Language recognition techniques using  deep learning method YOLO (You only look once). The project aims to read sign languages and interpret so the people who rely on these way of communication may benefit from.

**** Requirements ****


Python, and other packages 

**** Getting Started ****


*** Clone the repository from this code block: https://github.com/YuanWa1/yolo_sign_recognition.git

*** When cloned, go to project root directory and install all dependencies.

*** Once, all the prerequisites are complete, run the program with the testImage.py.


*** Technical issues encountered ***

   
The model struggled to correctly recognize gestures in video sequences, to address the problem, we plan to explore training on a dedicated video dataset in the future, aiming to enable real-time gesture recognition and translation for more practical applications.


*** Improvements/ Known Problems ***


The model struggled to correctly recognize gestures in video sequences, To address this, we will explore video datasets.
